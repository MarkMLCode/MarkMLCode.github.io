            You create a sphere of magical silence centered on a point within range. For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through this area. Creatures inside the sphere are deafened and cannot cast spells with verbal components.
            <br><br>
            Each creature within the silenced area when you cast this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes magically bound to the silence effect. Affected creatures can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themselves on a success and allowing them to act normally within the silenced area.
