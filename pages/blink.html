            When you cast this spell, you enter a state of rapid dimensional shifting between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane.
            <br><br>
            For the duration of the spell, any attack made against you or any spell/item that targets you has a 50% chance to fail and have no effect, as you briefly shift into the Ethereal Plane. This chance of failure doesn't apply when targeting yourself with a spell or item. 
            <br><br>
            You can see and hear the plane you originated from when in the ethereal plane, which is cast in shades of gray, but you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.
