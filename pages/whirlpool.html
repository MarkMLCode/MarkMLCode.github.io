        <div class="spell-description">
            You summon a powerful vortex in a body of water, creating a churning whirlpool that draws creatures into its grasp. The vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, expanding to 50 feet at the surface, and reaches 25 feet in height.
            <br><br>
            Each creature within the pool's area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and becomes restrained, pulled into the center of the vortex. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and can move freely out of the area.
            <br><br>
            A restrained creature remains trapped in the whirlpool for the spell's duration. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the Strength saving throw. On a success, it is no longer restrained and can leave the whirlpool's area.
            <br><br>
            <strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
